# IES-IPS-ACADEMY-BOT

This chatbot was created as a minor project submission for B.Tech in  CSIT 2019-2023, by 3rd year students. 

It uses web-scrapping, api, natural language processing, regex, and telebot api and is built in python. 

The main aim for buidling this project is to make it easier for students to access information such as info about college, college-notice  and departmental notice, scheme &amp; syllabus, contact details of college, placement details etc. which are a bit difficult to access because of vastness of insititute's website. Inaddition to that it also provides solutions to many problems that are not available on institute's site as well.

Our attempt is to create a platform where students just need to send a message to out chatbot in natural language(english) or using amazing UI and get everything they want with minimal efforts, without feeling trapped between tabs of website.
